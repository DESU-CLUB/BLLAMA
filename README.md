## ü¶ôüå≤ü§è BLLAMA: A BLIP2 + ALPACA-LORA pipeline

# Setup
1. Git clone this repository
2. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

# Training
### This is just a pipeline involving the use of both ALPACA and BLIP-2, without any prior finetuning. You can refer to the details in ALPACA_LORA's repo [here](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora) and the BLIP-2 training details on their GitHub page [here](https://github.com/salesforce/LAVIS/tree/main/projects/blip2). For the pipeline, I have used their model found on HuggingSpace [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Salesforce/BLIP2)

# Inference
1. cd to the cloned repo
2. Run ```python3 generate.py```
